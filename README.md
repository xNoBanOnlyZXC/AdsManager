The bot automatically keeps the specified advertisement at the bottom of the chat (up to N number of advertisement messages).

The bot has a notification system - if a user (who is not an administrator) sends /start to the bot, all administrators will receive a notification with the name, username and user ID.

The bot remembers the entire advertising post (pyrogram) or a post with 1 image (telebot) saving the data to the ads.json file

The bot remembers its advertising posts, i.e. after restarting the bot, it will still know what its last advertising posts were (last.dict)
